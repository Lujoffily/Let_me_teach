# Tutorial: Specific Regular Expression

Specific Regular Expression also known as REGEX, are powerful tools that developers use for pattern matching and text manipulation. In this tutorial, you will see the functionality of a specific regular expression and it will be breaken down by part and describing it's purpose.

## Summary

`/^[A-Za-z0-9]+$/` is the regular expression and will be explained in this tutorial, this regular expression matches strings containing only alphanumeric characters. Each part of the regex will be broken down into parts and  dissect it and will give explations.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors in regex are `^` and `$`. The anchors tells you the exact position in the string in which the march must occur.

° `^` asserts the start of the string.
° `$` asserts the end of the string.

### Quantifiers

Qantifiers specify how many time in the preceding element should be matched.

° `+` matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element ([A-Za-z0-9] in this case).
